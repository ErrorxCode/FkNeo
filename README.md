## ✨ Main Features

- **NeoExamShield emulation** (Emulate as official NeoExamShield extention, no need to install it)
- **Removed entire screen capturing** (Now you can start the test even with window or tab screen recording permission)
- **Allow tab/window**
- **Allow copy/paste**
- **Spoof screen recording**
- **Fullscreen bypass**
- **Easy 2 use**

The 2nd and the last 2nd feature is what makes this extention stand out from others. While other extention allows you to cheat, this also allowes you to hide your activity while cheating
